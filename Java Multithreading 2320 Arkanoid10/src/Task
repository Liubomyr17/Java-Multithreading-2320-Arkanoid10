Now let's get into the Canvas class.
It will contain a matrix (a two-dimensional array), where we will "draw".
The matrix has a width and a height.
And we will not store numbers (int) in it, but characters (char).
It is necessary:
a) Add two private fields width and height to the class.
b) Add the private field matrix (char [] []) to the class.
c) Add a constructor with two parameters of type int (width and height), the matrix field should be initialized with an empty array of dimension [height + 2] [width + 2].
d) Add getters and setters for all private fields of the class.

Requirements:
1. A private field width of type int must be created in the Canvas class.
2. In the Canvas class, a private height field of type int must be created.
3. In the Canvas class, a private matrix field of type char [] must be created.
4. In the Canvas class, a public getter must be created for the width field.
5. In the Canvas class, a public getter must be created for the height field.
6. In the Canvas class, a public getter for the matrix field must be created.
7. In the Canvas class, a public setter must be created for the width field.
8. In the Canvas class, a public setter must be created for the height field.
9. In the Canvas class, a public setter must be created for the matrix field.
10. In the Canvas class, a valid public constructor with two parameters of type int (width and height) must be created.
